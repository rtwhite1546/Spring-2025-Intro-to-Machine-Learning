    "# MTH 4224 / CSE 4224 - Homework 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: April 30, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points**: 65\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I did give some hints, but I did not teach about every built-in function you're going to need to use. This will *always* be the situation in real life. Be resourceful, read the documentation, Google your errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic Honesty**: Write your code from scratch. Learn from the Internet, talk to classmates or friends, ask me questions, but don't just copy blocks of code. Every submission I grade should be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit **one** Python notebook file for grading. Your file must include **mathematical work** (type it or insert pictures of your handwritten work), **text explanations** of your work, **well-commented code**, and the **outputs** from your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1: K-Means Objective Function (15 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ be a dataset and $\\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_k\\}$ a partition into clusters. Define $\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{|C_j|} \\sum_{x \\in C_j} x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** [5 pts]  \n",
    "Write the objective function that K-means attempts to minimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** [10 pts]  \n",
    "Prove that the mean $\\mu_j$ minimizes the sum of squared distances from points in cluster $C_j$ to a center.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2: Clustering in 2D (30 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the provided dataset `hw2_data.csv` (in https://github.com/rtwhite1546/Spring-2025-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/tree/main/data), which contains concentric circles and Gaussian blobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** [5 pts]  \n",
    "Plot the data. Describe the cluster structure you observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** [10 pts]  \n",
    "Apply K-means with \\(k = 3\\). Plot and explain whether the clusters make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** [10 pts] \n",
    "Apply DBSCAN with tuned parameters. Plot and compare the clustering to K-means. Which one performs better and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** [5 pts] \n",
    "How would switching from Euclidean to Manhattan distance affect each algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3: Clustering in Higher Dimensions (20 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the provided dataset `hw2_highdim_data.csv` at https://github.com/rtwhite1546/Spring-2025-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/tree/main/data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** [5 pts]  \n",
    "Load and normalize the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** [10 pts]  \n",
    "Apply K-means to cluster the data. Use silhouette scores or other methrids to tune $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** [10 pts] \n",
    "Reduce the data to 2D using PCA, MDS, and t-SNE and visualize the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** [5 pts]  \n",
    "Apply alternative methods (DBSCAN, OPTICS, GMM, or others) and compare performance using silhouette score."
